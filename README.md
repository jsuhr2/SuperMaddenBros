# SuperMaddenBros
Experimental Super Mario Bros. style game where plumber-turned-professor Madden must cross a short expanse of Binghamton's campus while avoiding Goombas! Level is pretty short, but gameplay and animation are clean which is groovy. Down Under by Men At Work plays when passing the poorly rendered Engineering Building, for any Australia fans out there! Collision with a Goomba straight on or from below triggers Game Over and bopping them on the head kills them. Win is triggered when arriving at the Clock Tower.
